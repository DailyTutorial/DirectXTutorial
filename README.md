# Useful Resources

## Programming Resources
 * [GameDev.net](http://www.gamedev.net) - An excellent (and most popular) resource for all things in game development. A great forum for when you become stuck. Also has many good articles on advanced topics.
 * [Wrox Publications](http://www.wrox.com) - Wrox is probably the best way to learn a new programming language. Their books pay special attention to detail and ease. I highly recommend Ivor Horton's Beginning Visual C++ 2012 for learning C++.
 * [CPlusPlus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/) - Don't want to buy Ivor Horton's book just to take a crash course in C++? Do this website's tutorial instead.
 * [Game Developer Magazine](http://www.gdmag.com/) - A great magazine that I highly recommend to any game developer. Each issue is filled with advanced game programming techniques, industry news and career opportunities.
